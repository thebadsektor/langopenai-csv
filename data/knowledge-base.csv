What information is included in the counseling appointment specifics?,"The counseling appointment specifics include important details about the client that are necessary for scheduling and conducting virtual counseling. This may include the client's name, age, gender, address, contact numbers, emergency contact person, hardware to be used (e.g., cellphone, laptop), internet provider, and alternative contact numbers."
How is the performance of student interns monitored and evaluated?,"The performance of student interns is monitored and evaluated by both LSPU (the university) and the Host Training Establishment (HTE). The SIPP coordinator, along with the dean of the LSPU college, utilizes standard procedures, instruments, and methodologies to assess the student interns. These may include oral and written observations, monthly reports, interviews, or conferences with the students."
What is the purpose of the briefing phase in virtual counseling?,"The purpose of the briefing phase in virtual counseling is to provide important information and guidelines to both the counselor and the client regarding the virtual counseling process. This phase includes discussions on various aspects such as time management, protocols, dos and don'ts during virtual counseling sessions, as well as briefing on informed consent and data privacy."
Why is it important to establish a specific time frame for the counseling process?,"Establishing a specific time frame for the counseling process is important to ensure that both the counselor and the client have clear boundaries and expectations regarding the duration of the session. By setting a specific time frame, it helps the counselor manage their schedule and availability, and it allows the client to plan their time accordingly. It promotes efficiency and helps maintain a structured and focused counseling session."
How should counselors handle late clients during virtual counseling sessions?,"Counselors should consider a leeway or grace period for late clients, typically around half an hour. If a client arrives within the given leeway, the counselor can proceed with the session.

By having intervals, counselors can ensure that they are fully present and prepared to provide quality counseling services to each client."
How should counselors manage turn-taking during virtual counseling sessions?,"During virtual counseling sessions, counselors should establish an agreement with the client on how to take turns in speaking.

By setting clear guidelines on turn-taking, both the counselor and the client can engage in a balanced and productive conversation."
What should counselors do when a client experiences a breakdown during a virtual counseling session?,"When a client experiences a breakdown during a virtual counseling session, counselors should have a pre-agreed process in place for handling such situations. This process should be clearly communicated to the client in advance, ensuring that they are aware of what to expect. Counselors may provide techniques such as deep breathing exercises to help the client regulate their emotions and create a safe space for them to express their concerns. It is essential for the counselor to be empathetic, supportive, and responsive to the client's needs during this time."
Why are keywords important in virtual counseling sessions?,"Keywords are important in virtual counseling sessions as they can be used as code words to indicate potential interruptions or sensitive situations. For example, if a client feels unsafe or believes someone may be listening, they can use a pre-determined keyword (e.g., ""whoa"") to signal the need for privacy or confidentiality. This helps maintain the safety and confidentiality of the counseling session, ensuring that the client feels secure in sharing their thoughts and concerns."

Once a resolution or decision is recommended or taken, the parties involved are informed accordingly, considering the nature and confidentiality of the grievance/resolution."
How should counselors handle emerging criminal activities during virtual counseling sessions?,"Counselors should be prepared to address emerging criminal activities during virtual counseling sessions. It is important for counselors to have a list of relevant organizations or resources that can assist in dealing with such situations. Establishing networks with auxiliary personnel, such as law enforcement or legal authorities, can be helpful. If the counselor becomes aware of criminal activities during a session, they should follow the appropriate reporting procedures and provide guidance to the client on how to seek assistance from the appropriate authorities."
What should counselors and clients do when the connection is cut during a virtual counseling session?,"In the event of a disconnection during a virtual counseling session, counselors should explain the protocol to the client beforehand. The counselor can guide the client on what to do in case of a disconnection, such as attempting to reconnect within a specified timeframe (e.g., 5 minutes). If reconnection is not possible due to ongoing connection issues or other problems, counselors should have a backup plan in place. This could involve contacting the client through alternative means, such as telephone or an alternative contact number, to continue the session and ensure continuity of care."
How should virtual counseling sessions be ended?,"At the end of a virtual counseling session, the client should end the video call when they have said goodbye.

What is the Target Delivery Mode for Flexible Learning?,"The LSPU Flexible Learning is an institutional response to the current and future challenges in instructional delivery. Using the results of the survey of the OVPAA and CIDQA Unit, flexible learning is contextually categorized: -2.1. Synchronous Online � learning is real-time via Internet 2.2. Asynchronous Online � students learn at different times and locations, no real-time interactions with Internet requirements (via LMS, discussion forum, self-guided materials, prerecorded videos) 2.3. E-Learning Offline � students are using digital learning resources package offline while NOT connected to Internet"
What is the definition of flexible learning?,"1.1 Flexible Learning is the design and delivery of programs, courses, and learning interventions that address learners� unique needs in terms of place, pace, process, and products of learning. It involves the use of digital and non-digital technology, and covers both face- to-face/in-person learning and out-of-classroom learning modes of delivery or a combination of modes of delivery. It ensures the conti- nuity of inclusive and accessible education when the use of tradi- tional modes of teachings not feasible, as in the occurrence of national emergencies (CHEd, 2020). 1.2. Flexible Learning is a pedagogical approach allowing flexibility of time, place and audience including, but not solely focused on, the use of technology. Although it commonly uses the delivery methods of distance education and facilities of education technology, this may vary depending on the levels of technology, availability of devices, internet connectivity, level of digital literacy and approaches (SEAMEO)."
What are the guidelines for helping teachers transition to online learning?,"While faculty are expected to be proactive and reflective in their teaching practice in face-to-face settings, it is really challenging for them to migrate to the new teaching and learning environment. Crucial to the approaches ou
lined below is the provision of an opportunity to explore potentialities of e- learning, by establishing a complete migration learning plan, designing and de-veloping an e-learning module from the migration plan template, and translating the e-learning module to the LSPU platform. Here are some guidelines to help teachers transition to online learning: Step 1. Cluster subjects based on learning outcomes and disciplinal content.
The Faculty may conduct curriculum mapping to cluster the subjects according to the nature of the discipline. Some subjects may also remain stand-alone.
Step 2. Examine the syllabi and review course intended learning outcomes. The University Cluster Curriculum Review Committee (UCCRC) com- posed of the VPAA, CIDQA, Dean / Associate Dean, Program Coordinator, Subject Matter Expert, GAD Unit, and ITSO Unit, will examine and calibrate the soundness, appropriateness, and gender sensitivity of the identified Essential Intended Learning Outcomes.
Step 3. Complete migration learning plan template. The Migration E-Learning Course Plan should be accomplished by all faculty of each course as soon as they receive their teaching load for the incoming semester/
term. It will be submitted to the UCCRC for review and evaluation. The CIDQA Chairperson will endorse the accomplished Template to the CIDQA for recommendation to the Vice � President for Academic
Affairs (VPAA) for approval. The VPAA may approve the Migration Learning Plan Template at least two (2) weeks before the opening of classes.
Step 4. Design and develop a module from the migration plan template 4.1 LSPU Course GuideThe Course Guide is a document which serves as the learner�s guide in completing the course. It contains the general information about the course and what students need to pass the course. Further, it serves as a learning contract between the teacher and the students directly lifted and migrated from the OBE Syllabi.
4.2 LSPU Self-Paced Learning Module The university shall adopt the Self-Paced Learning Module (SLM) which was crafted during the Webinar Workshop.
